Everyone is rushing to create clean cars, whether battery or hydrogen powered engines, and bask in their cleanness.<br>But the green alibi hides behind it a dirty truth: Zero emission does not mean zero pollution. Mining rare Earth materials required for zero-emissions engines, building charging stations, and the complex logistics surrounding the “clean” industries will take a heavy toll on Earth. In the end, the only ones who will gain from the “clean revolution” are the tycoons who are selling it to us, and the government officials who placate them for their own reasons.<br>Where is Greta Thunberg these days?

We will have to pay for it elsewhere.<br>For this reason, I think that the crux of the problem is not emissions, but our behavior toward nature and toward our fellow human beings.

I have noticed the sick sentiment from Republicans that it is OK for older, sicker, obese people and even children to get sick or die from Covid because somehow they don’t matter. This epidemic could have been over if all Americans had gotten vaccinated but many Americans simply don’t care or are afraid of vaccines. Trump didn’t take the virus seriously, promoted cures that didn’t work and even when there was a vaccine didn’t care enough to get it distributed to all Americans because as he said ‘it wasn’t his job’. Trump who did get vaccinated could have shown leadership by urging Americans to get vaccinated but when he once told his supporters to get vaccinated quickly backed down because he got booed.Trump’s uncaring attitude and lack of leadership most likely caused him to lose the trust of the American people and cost him a second term.',\n",

I’ll start with your last claim: The CIA did NOT “make up” the term conspiracy theory! “The Oxford English Dictionary defines conspiracy theory as &quot;the theory that an event or phenomenon occurs as a result of a conspiracy between interested parties; spec. a belief that some covert but influential agency (typically political in motivation and oppressive in intent) is responsible for an unexplained event.&quot; It cites a 1909 article in The American Historical Review as the earliest usage example, although it also appeared in print as early as April 1870.”<br>2. To extrapolate claims about current events solely on revelations of of events from half a century ago, is political apophenia. It results in open ended paranoia (like you’re demonstrating here).',\n",

              "   {'context': '@Luntershaptop Fukinov right? It’s crazy. I just find it sad how people can’t even have a political conversation these days without immediately attacking the other for their views. That’s the biggest problem with this country imo, especially in Congress… the left is much worse I think tho, not saying the right doesn’t have their issues… but they end up having to spend most of their time defending themselves or correcting the outright lies that come from the other side. If people could just say… ok I know we don’t and probably never will agree on certain politics/policies… but rather than lying about each other and calling each other racist or communist or all the other crazy things they both say… why don’t we lay all our ducks out on the table, and figure out solutions that work for both of us, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY the people of this country. With a 2 party system there unfortunately will AWAYS be disagreements and people that pick sides… but when one side is literally trying to FORCE everyone to either join their party or be shamed, cancelled and constantly attacked it does no good. And when 90% of the media ONLY covers the good things their political party does and ONLY the BAD things their rivals do it does no good. It just constantly keeps driving people further apart and it will NEVER bring peace. We sadly know the media thrives on this because the more negative and drama that comes out of a situation the more people latch on to it and brings in their views and revenue. But it’s literally destroying this country. I mean I don’t agree with a lot of policies on the left, and I lean right with a lot of policies I would like. But I also am socially liberal on a lot of my beliefs as well. That’s why I’m more center/independent..And I don’t agree with the entire agenda the right tries to push…. Like obviously climate change is a problem caused by humans and big corporations, but we also can’t just shut down our economy and drive our gas prices thru the roof is other players are not following by the same rules like China which does not abide by any of the same rules we have to when it comes to pollution and destroying sea wildlife and certain things. But I also agree people like Jeff Bezos should be paying his FAIR SHARE OF TAXES instead of paying 0$ which is what the right advocates for. The bottom line is this country, it’s political system and people need to stop attacking one another and learn how to WORK TOGETHER, and stop blaming each other for everything. It’s getting old and it’s never gonna get us anywhere. And we honestly need term limits to get these life long politicians that go from wanting to help their community and the people to feel like they control this entire country after they’ve been around for decades. But hey, that’s just my opinion, I’m open to hearing what someone else who might disagree with me thinks and see how we can work together. But when you’re so ignorant you just call anyone who supports someone you don’t like a facist without even knowing them it’s pretty pathetic',\n",
